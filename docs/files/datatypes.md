The data types are the different kind of data that you can use as facts.
The rule engines expose different data types to work with:

### String
This is a well known `string` type

### Number
A number is a representation of an integer value. In this case is a wrapper for a `int64` data type
 
### Float
Floats are also numeric types. They represent the decimal numbers implemented as `float64`

### Boolean
The boolean are useful to assert a condition as `true` or `false`

### Date
Represents a `time.Time` data type

The library has a set of built-in functions to work with `date` values easily
